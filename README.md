- With the advent of Covid-19, video conferencing and video calls have become more popular, than it ever was before. Zoom, the video conferencing app, is a popular proof of that. The video conferencing app experienced a ten times increase in usage over the last few years (Rahul De', Neena Pandey, Abhipsa Pal, 2020). Just recently I and a friend of mine had a video call on Snapchat. We experienced a lot of issues. The video and the audio kept lagging. In addition to that, the call went off on its own multiple times. This led to the question, "Is SnapChat's video call generally bad?" or "Was it just a problem that I and my friend faced due to bad service or due to the fact that the call was international?".

I wanted to try out my newly found superpowers and answer my burning questions. So I downloaded a dataset namely <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/databar/10k-snapchat-reviews">"10K Snapchat Reviews"</a> from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> to use to perform my analysis.To achieve my goal I'm going to be using the popular data analytics libraries offered by **Python** along with **nltk**, **vaderSentiment**, and **textblob** for the *Sentiment Analysis* and *Feature Extraction* of the dataset. The two concepts that would aid me in answering my burning questions about snapchat. Follow me along on my journey and let's see what we uncover üßê. Run the notebook on Google collab.
